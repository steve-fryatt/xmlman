<title>Documents</title>

<section>
<p>An <cite>XMLMan</cite> document consists of one or more XML files. They are notionally in UTF-8 encoding, although users creating files on RISC&nbsp;OS can avoid this by sticking to ASCII and using entities for the &ldquo;top-bit&rdquo; characters. This approach also makes it easier to store the files in source code management systems on other platforms.</p>

<p>The files mostly follow the standard XML syntax rules, which are as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tags are enclosed in &lt; and &gt; angle brackets, and use lower case.</p></li>
<li><p>Attribute names are in lower case, and their values are strings enclosed in double-quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Entities are lower case text enclosed by &amp; and a semicolon. A subset of the HTML&nbsp;5 entities are supported.</p></li>
<li><p>The &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and &amp; characters are reserved, and must <em>always</em> be represented by the <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, <code>&amp;quot;</code> and <code>&amp;amp;</code> entities when they appear in the manual text.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Comments are enclosed in <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>, and can span multiple lines.</p>

<p>There is one small extension to the XML syntax, which is that some attributes can contain their own entities <em>and</em> tags. These are used sparingly, and will be clearly documented when they arise.</p>

<title>Output modes</title>

<p><cite>XMLMan</cite> can output documents in a number of formats, as listed in <ref id="table-documents-output-modes"/>.</p>

<table id="table-documents-output-modes" title="Supported output modes">
<columns>
<coldef>Mode</coldef>
<coldef>Name</coldef>
</columns>
<row><col>Plain Text</col><col>text</col></row>
<row><col>HTML</col><col>html</col></row>
<row><col>StrongHelp</col><col>strong</col></row>
</table>

<p>The mode names are used when referring to them within source XML files or as command line parameters when specifying the formats to be generated.</p>

<title>Character sets and encodings</title>

<p><cite>XMLMan</cite> source files are always treated as being in UTF-8. To make it easier to work on different platforms, many standard HTML entities are supported &ndash; for example <code>&amp;ndash;</code> for the en-dash in this sentence, or <code>&amp;Aacute;</code> for a capital A with an acute accent (&Aacute;). By sticking to standard &ldquo;ASCII-range&rdquo; characters and using entities, it is possible to create files which can be safely edited on both RISC&nbsp;OS and other platforms.</p>

<p>The encoding used for output files is specified when calling <cite>XMLMan</cite> from the command line. Characters which can be represented in the target encoding will be converted and written to the output, while those which can&rsquo;t will be replaced by a question mark &ndash; a warning will be issued for each one. Some output modes handle the conversion differently, and this is documented in their specific sections of this manual.</p>

<p>The encodings listed in <ref id="table-documents-encodings" /> are supported.</p>

<section id="documents-references">
<title>Internal references</title>

<p>Internal references link from areas of the text to objects such as chapters, sections, tables and code blocks (&ldquo;listings&rdquo;). These enable items such as &ldquo;see Chapter 2&rdquo; or &ldquo;as shown in Table 4&rdquo; to be entered easily, along with hyperlinks where the output format allows for these.</p>

<p>Reference IDs are specified using the <name>id</name> attribute within appropriate target tags, and can be any alphanumeric text. However, references map to object IDs in HTML output and since the IDs <name>head</name>, <name>head-liner</name>, <name>body</name>, <name>body-liner</name>, <name>foot</name> and <name>foot-liner</name> are used within the page structure, these are not available within a manual.</p>
</section>

<section id="external-definition">
<title>External definitions</title>

<p>It is possible to supply externally-sourced content for a manual, in the form of short text definitions supplied with the <param>-define</param> parameter on the command line. The primary use case for this functionality is to support the embedding of build dates and version numbers into software manuals.</p>

<p>In the manual document, these defines can be accessed using <code>&lt;define&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<code>&lt;p&gt;The software was built on &lt;define name=&quot;builddate&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
