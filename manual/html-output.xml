<title>Character encoding</title>

<p>The selected output encoding will control the way that the HTML output is generated. An attempt will be made to map all characters into the target encoding; if this fails, then an entity will be used. Named entities are used in preference, but if one isn&rsquo;t available, then a numeric entity (in the form <code>&amp;#1234;</code>) will be used instead.</p>

<p>If output is in UTF-8 mode, it follows that the only characters to be output as entities will be the standard &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and &amp; as required by the HTML standard. If the use of entities is desired, this can be forced by selecting 7-Bit output mode: this will still output a file identified as being UTF-8 in order to achieve maximum compatibility, but will only use single-byte character encodings. All characters outside of this range will therefore be written out as entities.</p>

<p>The encoding will be written in the file header, in the form <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;&gt;</code> (this example being Acorn Latin 1), if a suitable character set is known. For some encodings, where a suitable character set is not known, the charset declaration will be omitted.</p>
