<title>Document File Structure</title>

<summary>This is very definitely a placeholder summary, as we attempt to test out the functionality of this system. What can it all mean? Document File Structure? What on earth is that!</summary>

<section>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with writing single-tasking software &ndash; on any platform &ndash; then writing an application to work under the RISC&nbsp;OS Wimp can be a confusing experience. Conventional software is linear: execution starts at the top and runs through to the end. The code will follow any functions, subroutines or &ndash; perhaps &ndash; gotos that it meets, but this is all under the control of the software developer.</p>

<p>Writing for the Wimp &ndash; or, indeed, any other windowing system &ndash; isn&rsquo;t like that. The user can interact with an application via its windows and dialogue boxes in a host of different ways: clicking on buttons, scrolling the contents, opening menus, dragging other windows over the top and requiring things to be redrawn. Other software running on the system might also want to interact and exchange information.</p>

<p>The way that software interacts with the Wimp hasn&rsquo;t really changed since the days of Arthur &ndash; although there have been some small changes to accommodate the system of cooperative multitasking, they don&rsquo;t alter anything in a fundamental way. All access to the Wimp is via SWI calls: using the <code>SYS</code> command in BASIC or &ndash; in the case of this tutorial &ndash; OSLib when working in C.</p>
